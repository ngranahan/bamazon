## Using the Bamazon Customer CLI App

Run the app in the command line to see a list of available products in the local Mysql database. After products load, the user will be prompted to select an item by entering the item id, then select the quantity. The app will then update the database with the new quantity, summarize the order, then prompt the user to continue shopping.
